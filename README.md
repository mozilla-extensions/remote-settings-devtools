# Development


This addon relies on the [Experiments API](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/extensions/webextensions/basics.html#webextensions-experiments) in order to expose Remote Settings internals to the Web Extension.

Unsigned addons with experiments can only be loaded in Firefox Nightly and Developer Edition, with specific preferences set.

1. Download [Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly)
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. We'll use the `web-ext` runner, with a persistent profile:
```bash
npx web-ext run --verbose --firefox-binary /path/to/nightly/firefox -s extension --firefox-profile rs-devtools --profile-create-if-missing
```
4. (*first run only*) Adjust preferences in `about:config`:
- `xpinstall.signatures.required`: `false`
- `extensions.experiments.enabled`: `true`
5. Reload the addon to take these prefs changes into account, in `about:debugging`
6. Enjoy!
